# OLED
There are information about OLED in Wiki, I tried my best to run the code on C but it did not work as I extected. On the otherhand, I tried to use Arduino and it was easy to plug the wires and make the OLED screen works and shows texts or pictures. There were good sources to get OLED library which has all methods that could expect to use such as phases, texts, pictures and ect and this one would be attached in the code section. There is also a file where I put a picture of Circruit digram and my outupt when I tested the OLED through arduino.
